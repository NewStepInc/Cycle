	------- Project: Android cycle view ----------
	contact: Alfred Wallner, dev@vipos.com

	Summary:
	Activity with canvas in center and several labels on top and bottom, as shown in video.
	Minimum compatible with API 11, if possible with API 10 (2.3)
	The Activity is part of an app, and will be launched with several launch parameters.

	Deliverables:
		Java source code and resources files (xml ...)


	Specs:
	1) 
		- use attached xml resources as starting point (in order to have same look as other app components)
	 	- must adapt to all screen sizes and densities
	   	- only Android SDK, no dependencies on external libraries (submit request if needed)

	2) the activity needs to accept these launch paramaters:

	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = "cycle_duration"	// the total number of days in cycle
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = "cycle_day"	// the current day in cycle (always today), arrow points to that day
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = "period_length"	// number of days from day 1 to period_length displayed in red color 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = "ovulation"	// ovulation day displayed in green color, the 3 days preceding ovulation day displaying in light green color 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_LANG = "lang"		// language 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_THEME_ID = "theme_id"	// theme

	Activity onCreate -> call getParams()
	protected void getParams() {
            Bundle extras = getIntent().getExtras();
            if(extras != null)  {
                String lang = extras.getString(LAUNCH_PARAM_LANG);
				....
			}
	}


	3) normal case: (video 1)
		a) at the top of the screen, there will be 1 animated label
		b) at the bottom of the screen, there will be 3 animated labels
		c) cycle wheel: components: INNER_CIRCLE, OUTER_CIRCLE, ARROW
			- is slightly open, arrow makes 1 full rotation (starting at top) and 1 partial rotation
			- label in INNER_CIRCLE displays the cycle day (LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY)
			- tapping on numbers in OUTER_CIRCLE displays localized date in INNER_CIRCLE (for 3 seconds, then back to showing cycle day)
			- tapping on numbers in OUTER_CIRCLE highlights the tapping area with a circle for 3 seconds (or less if continue tapping other labels)
			- display logic:
				OUTER_CIRCLE total sections (labels) = LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION (eg. 1 to 28)
				OUTER_CIRLE colors (see hex colors below):
					c1: red = 1 .. LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH ( eg 1 .. 5 )
					c2: dark green = LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION ( eg 12 )
					c3: light green = LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION - 3 .. LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION - 1  (eg 9 .. 11)
					c4: light gray = all remaining sections of OUTER_CIRCLE
				ARROW end point = LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY
				The color of the ARROW + INNER_CIRCLE matches the color of the OUTER_CIRCLE at the ARROW endpoint.
			- show 3 bottom boxes: 
				first: big bottom box animates up
				second: 2 half size boxes animate in from left and right
			- hex colors  
				c1: HEX_COLORS_PERIOD "ea1d4c,f38a77,ff9467,f67173,e97a95,ac85c6,c0514c,f85464"	// red 
				c2: HEX_COLORS_OVU "63a11e,6f7a24,34a874,24a969,388798,0b9098,5f7426,7f9949"	// dark green
				c3: HEX_COLORS_FERTILE "8fd437,989d48,89c05a,99bf65,40b8ae,58b9b2,83941b,9bd52"	// light green
				c4: HEX_COLOR_BASE "c5c5c5"	// light gray
				c5: TEXT_COLOR "404040" // dark gray 
				c6: COLOR_PERIOD_LATE = TEXT_COLOR
				depending on LAUNCH_PARAM_THEME_ID (values 0 - 7), select the appropriate colors from arrays above
				(NOTE: during testing, just grab the first color in PERIOD,OVU and FERTILE (always THEME_ID 0) 


	4) special case: CYCLE_DAY > CYCLE_DURATION (video 2)
		- the cycle wheel needs to have CYCLE_DAY days
		- the cycle day will be the last day in the wheel and the arrow needs to point to it
		- the days between CYCLE_DURATION and CYCLE_DAY must be display in dark gray (COLOR_PERIOD_LATE)
		- at the bottom of the screen, there will be only 1 label, and it says "PERIOD LATE x DAYS" , where x = CYCLE_DAY - CYCLE_DURATION
