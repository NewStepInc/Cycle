TESTING:
Test cases with different Activity launch parameters
Please create a launch screen with a button for each test case below, and send me the apk. 

1) 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = 24  (wheel is 1 to 24)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = 7		(arrow goes to 7)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = 5	( days 1 .. 5 in red )
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = 12  ( day 12 dark green, days 9 .. 11 light green ) 
	shows 3 bottom boxes

2) 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = 33  (wheel is 1 to 33)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = 22 		(arrow goes to 22)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = 4	( days 1 .. 4 in red )
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = 22  ( day 22 dark green, days 19 .. 21 light green ) 
	shows 3 bottom boxes

3) 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = 53  (wheel is 1 to 50)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = 32 	(arrow goes to 32)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = 6	( days 1 .. 6 in red )
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = 35  ( day 35 dark green, days 32 .. 34 light green ) 
	shows 3 bottom boxes

4) 
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = 41  (wheel is 1 to 41)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = 2 	(arrow goes to 2)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = 6	( days 1 .. 6 in red )
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = 26  ( day 26 dark green, days 23 .. 25 light green ) 
	shows 3 bottom boxes

5) special case CYCLE_DAY > CYCLE_DURATION
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DURATION = 42  (wheel is 1 to 47)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_CYCLE_DAY = 47		(arrow goes to 47)
	LAUNCH_PARAM_PERIOD_LENGTH = 6	( days 1 .. 6 in red )
	LAUNCH_PARAM_OVULATION = 30  ( not showing green, instead days 43 .. 47 are dark gray COLOR_LATE_PERIOD) 
	shows 1 bottom box


Additional test cases may be added (if there are failures with the above).
